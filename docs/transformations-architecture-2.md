# Transformation Architecture Progress Report

This document reviews the evolution of the transformation pipeline since the original plan in `transformations-architecture.md` and outlines the remaining work.

## 1. Changes Since the Original Plan

- **Pipeline integrated into the engine.** `Engine` now constructs a `PassManager` via `DefaultPassPipeline.Create()` before running legacy passes.
- **Constant folding refinements.** `FoldConstantsPass` now sign‑extends unsigned constants during signed comparisons and guards against shift counts that exceed operand bit width.
- **Expanded test coverage.** New unit tests exercise the constant folding pass and the default pipeline.
- **Legacy transformation fallback.** Several passes still reside in `LegacyTransformations` and are invoked after the managed pipeline.

## 2. Comparison with the Original Plan

| Planned Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Core abstractions (`ITransformationPass`, `PassManager`, `IRRewriter`) | Completed |
| Migrate existing passes (`SimplifyRedundantAssign`, `SimplifyArithmeticIdentities`, `FoldConstants`) | Completed |
| Unit tests for migrated passes | Completed |
| Default pass pipeline and updated call sites | Completed |
| Remove monolithic `Transformations` class | **In progress** – legacy version remains and is still referenced by `Engine` |
| Migrate remaining passes (dead code elimination, loop canonicalization, etc.) | Not yet started |
| Rule‑based pattern engine | Not implemented |
| Configuration and dependency declaration for passes | Not implemented |
| Documentation referencing new architecture | Partially complete |

## 3. Updated Plan

1. **Migrate remaining legacy passes.**
   - Port `SimplifyLogicalNots`, `FrameObjectClusteringAndRspAlias`, and constant‑mapping utilities into dedicated `*Pass` classes.
   - Expand the default pipeline to include the new passes and remove direct calls from `Engine`.
2. **Eliminate `LegacyTransformations`.**
   - After all passes migrate, delete the legacy class and adjust any lingering references.
3. **Introduce pass configuration and dependencies.**
   - Allow passes to expose options via constructors and enable `PassManager` to order passes based on declared dependencies.
4. **Implement the rule‑based pattern engine.**
   - Replace ad‑hoc logic in passes with declarative rewrite rules to simplify maintenance.
5. **Enhance documentation and examples.**
   - Update `README` and example code to demonstrate building custom pipelines.
6. **Testing and CI.**
   - Add unit tests for new passes and extend integration tests for the full pipeline.

This incremental plan continues the refactor toward a fully modular and testable transformation system while removing remaining legacy dependencies.
